        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The scope of this project is to explore the feasibility of creating and using a game to generate ideation and thought from the game's players about the city they live in and the issues that affect it.</p>
         The aim of the game is for players to use it as a platform to develop ideation in order to tackle different challenges faced by Limerick (Transport, Pollution, Derelict Sites etc) that the community can engage in a cooperative and fun way.</p>
         Participants will be encouraged to cooperate with each other to develop their own ideas as the end objective is reliant on their decision-making.
         During the game, participants will have to deal with constraints such as resource management, event cards and the roll of dice that influence city management and development. </p>
        <p>The goals for the project boil down to creating a fun and mechanically sound game that encourages discourse and ideation from participants. It also boils down to being as a tool that can help get the city community involved in tackling issues, such as pollution and congestion.</p>
        <p>This website in its current state is a prototype to act as a companion to the design game, the main functions of this website are:</p>
        <ul><li>Provide information about the project</li>
        <li>Show updates to the city based on what has been learnt from the design game sessions</li>
        <li>Provide a place for people to download rules and material for the design game so they can run their own sessions</li>
        <li>A place for people to organise their own sessions and maybe even provide feedback or discuss issues</li></ul>
